      <h1>Using p5 with a screen reader</h1>

      <p>          
        This page introduces some of the screen reader friendly features of the p5js web editor, it provides an overview of accessible outputs, and examples and tutorials on how to get started with p5 when using a screen reader.
      </p>
      <p>
        p5.js is a library that starts with the original goal of Processing –to make to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners– and reinterprets it for the web using the metaphor of a software sketchbook with a set of drawing functionality. With p5.js we are able to draw in the canvas. The canvas is perhaps the most inaccessible element in HTML. The reason for this is simple: the canvas behaves just like a physical canvas, once you put paint on it, it covers up what’s behind it, making it hard to understand how the pixels comprise shapes and elements. Within the p5.js web editor it is possible to access the content of the canvas using a screen reader through text, a spatial table, and sound outputs.
      </p>


      <h2>What is the p5.js Web Editor</h2>

      <p>
        The p5.js web editor is a essentially a web page where you can type code in p5.js and run the code to view the output. It allows us to code in and for the browser. The web editor has features that make it screen reader friendly. You can access the <a href="http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/">p5 web editor here.</a>
      </p>

      <h2>Pairings</h2>
      <p>
        Using the p5.js web editor with a screen reader works better when you have one of the following screen reader/browser/operating system pairings:
        <ul>
          <li>Red + Green = Yellow</li>
          <li>Red + Blue = Purple</li>
          <li>Green + Blue = Cyan (blue-green)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <h2>Outputs</h2>
      <p>
        With a screen reader we can access the content of the canvas through the following outputs:
      </p>
      
      <h3>Plain Text Output</h3>
      <p>
        This output describes the visual content present on the canvas in plain text.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Table Output</h3>
      <p>
        The table output laids out the content of the canvas in the form of a table based on the spatial location of each element.

      </p>
      
      <h3>Sound Output</h3>
      <p>
        This mode explains the movement of the objects present in the canvas. Top to bottom movement is represented by a decrease in frequency and left to right through panning.
      </p>
      
      <h2>How to select an output:</h2>
      <p>
        In the p5.js web editor there are two ways to select the accessible outputs that we want to make available. 
        <ol>
          <li>
            When we press the “play sketch, button” accessible to screen readers the “plain-text output” will automatically be available. 
          </li>
          <li>
            If we want to access other outputs we should do the following: 
            <ul>
              <li> 
                First, stop the sketch by pressing the “stop sketch, button” and go to “Settings”.
              </li>
              <li> 
                Within settings we must find the “Accessibility” tab.
              </li>
              <li> 
                In the “Accessibility” tab and under the “Accessible text-based canvas” section we can choose our preferred outputs.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Within “Settings” and under the “Accessibility” tab it is also possible to activate a lint warning sound that should make debugging easier. In “Settings” and under the  “General Settings” tab we can increase the size of the font and select a high contrast theme. After choosing our settings we can close the “Settings” window and go back to coding and playing our sketch.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is possible to add these accessible outputs to p5 sketches outside of the p5.js web editor by including the p5.accessibility.js library. <a href="">You can learn more about the library here.</a>
      </p>
      
      <h3>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
      <p>
        There are also ways to turn on the accessible outputs using keyboard shortcuts. Once we are on the code editor area we can use the following shortcuts (we have listed the shortcuts  for Windows computers, if you are using Mac OS please use the command key instead of control):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Shift + Control +1 - Turns on ALL the accessible output options, including audio
        </li>
        <li>
          Shift + Control +2 - Turns off ALL the accessible output options
        </li>
        <li>
          Control + Enter - This is used to run a sketch. If you already have accessibility options turned on, they will show up as well
        </li>
        <li>
          Shift + Control + Enter - This is used to stop a sketch.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The full list of shortcuts is also available in the p5 web editor, under Keyboard Shortcuts in the Help and Feedback section of the menu
      </p>
      <h3>Text output for Lesson 1</h3>
      <h3>Text output for Lesson 1</h3>
      
      <h1>Lessons</h1>
      <h2>Lesson 1: Hello World</h2>
      <p>
        In this section we go through some basic functions in p5 and look at how the screen reader will read the output. 

        There are two main functions we will use in our programs. The setup() function runs once, and is typically used for initialization, or for creating a program that does not need a loop running code repeatedly. The draw() function runs over and over again, and is used to perform a certain action repeatedly and for animation.
        Now we can open the editor: alpha.p5js.org and look for the code edit area. If you notice, there’s some code there already. Whenever you open the editor by default it will create a setup() function and a draw() function. However, for our first "Hello World" program we will take a step back and delete everything. Once we have a blank editor, we create a setup() block and add one line:
      </p>
      
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">   
        function setup() {
          createCanvas(200,200);
        }
      </code></pre>   
      
    <p>
      The createCanvas() function creates a canvas for us  to draw  or display the output. The canvas is the space on which the output is “drawn” or displayed. The code above creates a canvas of width and height 200 pixels. Since there is no movement, we will take a look only at the text and table outputs.
    </p>
    <h3>Text output for Lesson 1</h3>
    <p>
      Your output is a 200 by 200 white canvas containing the following 0 object
    </p>
    <h3>Table output for Lesson 1</h3>
    <p>
      white canvas is 200 by 200 of area 40000 contains 0 objects
    </p>
    <p>
      As expected, the outputs do not have any details apart from that of the canvas. Now, let’s move on to the next lesson where we add some basic shapes.
    </p>

      <h2>Lesson 2: Basic Shapes</h2>
      <p>
        In this example, we will draw an ellipse on the top left, and a rectangle on the bottom right of the canvas of size 500 by 500 pixels. First, let's create the canvas and draw a shape in the setup function. Feel free to copy the code to the editor and run it.
      </p>
      
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">   
        function setup() {
          createCanvas(500, 500);
          ellipse(50,50,20,20);
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        This code creates a canvas of 500 by 500 pixels and then draws an ellipse. The first 2 numbers we pass to the ellipse indicate where the center of the ellipse will be on the canvas. In this case, that is 50 and 50 pixels. The next 2 numbers indicate the width and height of the ellipse. In this case, they are both 20 pixels, implying we want to draw a circle. It is important to note that the top left corner of the canvas is point 0,0 pixels and the bottom right corner of the canvas is point 500,500 pixels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we can also type this code a bit differently. We can create the canvas in the setup() function and draw the shape in the draw() function. 
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-javascript">   
        function setup() {
          createCanvas(500, 500);
        }
        function draw() {
          ellipse(50,50,20,20);
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        In the previous case, the ellipse is drawn ONCE in setup and never again. But, in this case, the ellipse is drawn again and again in the canvas. Since, the numbers passed to the ellipse are the same each time, it doesn’t make a difference. However, if we wanted to change it’s position each time and make it move, then we would have to do it in draw.
      </p>
      <p>
        NOTE: remember, that everything in the canvas is drawn one over the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case the output will be following:
      </p>
      
      <h3>Text output for Lesson 2</h3>
      <p>
        The overview for the text output contains “Your output is a 500 by 500 white canvas containing the following 1 object:”. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This description is followed by a list of elements where the shape, color, position, and area of each element are described (in this case: “white ellipse at top left covering 0.13% of the canvas” ). Each element can be selected to get more details. A table of elements is also provided. In this table, shape, color, location, coordinates and area are described (example: “white ellipse   location=top left    coordinates =50x,50y    area=0.13%”).
      </p>
      <h3>Table output for Lesson 2</h3>
      <p>
        The overview for the table output contains “white canvas is 500 by 500 of area 250000 Contains 1 objects - 1 ellipse”
      </p>
      <p>
        This is followed by a table that describes the content spatially. It is a 10 by 10 table structure where each element is placed on a cell of the table depending on its position. Within each cell an element the color and type of shape of that element are available (example: “white ellipse”). These descriptions can be selected individually to get more details. A list of elements where shape, color, location, coordinates and area are described (example: “white ellipse   location=top left    coordinates =50x,50y    area=0.13%”) is also available.
      </p>
      <p> 
        You can try the <a href="http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/mathura/sketches/rk4uO1bJX">basic shapes example on the p5 editor</a>
      </p>
      
      <h3>Lesson 3: Color</h3>
      <p>
        In these examples, we  look at different ways to add color to our sketch
        First, let’s look at ‘background()’. We can use this function to add a background color to the canvas. Copy the below code to try it out.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        function setup() {
          createCanvas(500, 500);
          background(255,0,0);
        }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          Here, we have given the color in RGB format. In this format we can describe colors by saying how much, Red, Green and Blue the color has. RGB values must be integers between 0 and 255 with 0 being no color, and 255 highest amount of a certain color. The outputs will now contain “Red (255,0,0) canvas”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we can give color to our shapes using the function, fill().
        </p>
      
          
      
      <script type="text/p5"  data-autoplay>
function draw() {
  background(255);  
  noStroke(); 

  // Bright red
  fill(255,0,0);
  ellipse(20,20,16,16);

  // Dark red
  fill(127,0,0);
  ellipse(40,20,16,16);

  // Pink (pale red)
  fill(255,200,200);
  ellipse(60,20,16,16);
}
      </script>

      

      <h2>Color Transparency</h2>

      <p>In addition to the red, green, and blue components of each color, there is an additional optional fourth component, referred to as the color's "alpha." Alpha means transparency and is particularly useful when you want to draw elements that appear partially see-through on top of one another. The alpha values for an image are sometimes referred to collectively as the "alpha channel" of an image.</p>
      <p>It is important to realize that pixels are not literally transparent, this is simply a convenient illusion that is accomplished by blending colors. Behind the scenes, p5.js takes the color numbers and adds a percentage of one to a percentage of another, creating the optical perception of blending. (If you are interested in programming "rose-colored" glasses, this is where you would begin.)</p>

      <p>Alpha values also range from 0 to 255, with 0 being completely transparent (i.e., 0% opaque) and 255 completely opaque (i.e., 100% opaque).</p>

      <script type="text/p5"  data-autoplay>
  createCanvas(100, 100);
  fill(0,0,255);
  rect(0,0,50,100);

  // 255 means 100% opacity.
  fill(255,0,0,255);
  rect(0,0,100,20);

  // 75% opacity.
  fill(255,0,0,191);
  rect(0,25,100,20);

  // 55% opacity.
  fill(255,0,0,127);
  rect(0,50,100,20);

  // 25% opacity.
  fill(255,0,0,63);
  rect(0,75,100,20); 
      
      </script>
     
      <h2>Custom Color Ranges</h2>

      <p>
      RGB color with ranges of 0 to 255 is not the only way you can handle color in p5.js, in fact, it allows us to think about color any way we like. For example, you might prefer to think of color as ranging from 0 to 100 (like a percentage). You can do this by specifying a custom <a href="/reference/#/p5/colorMode">colorMode()</a>colorMode()</a>. 
      </p> 
      
      <pre><code>
      colorMode(RGB,100);
      </code></pre>

      <p>The above function says: "OK, we want to think about color in terms of red, green, and blue. The range of RGB values will be from 0 to 100."</p>

      <p>Although it is rarely convenient to do so, you can also have different ranges for each color component:</p>

      <pre><code>
      colorMode(RGB,100,500,10,255);
      </code></pre>

      <p>Now we are saying "Red values go from 0 to 100, green from 0 to 500, blue from 0 to 10, and alpha from 0 to 255."</p>

      <p>Finally, while you will likely only need RGB color for all of your programming needs, you can also specify colors in the HSB (hue, saturation, and brightness) mode. Without getting into too much detail, HSB color works as follows:</p>

      <img src="../assets/learn/color/hsb.png">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Hue</b>—The color type, ranges from 0 to 255 by default.</li>
        <li><b>Saturation</b>—The vibrancy of the color, 0 to 255 by default.</li>
        <li><b>Brightness</b>—The, well, brightness of the color, 0 to 255 by default.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>With <a href="/reference/#/p5/colorMode">colorMode()</a> you can set your own ranges for these values. Some prefer a range of 0-360 for hue (think of 360 degrees on a color wheel) and 0-100 for saturation and brightness (think of 0-100%).</p>
